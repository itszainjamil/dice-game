This is one of the projects of the JavaScript course I did from Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.

# Rules:

If the user generates a dice roll:

1- If the number is other than 1, it gets added to the current score.

2- If it is a '1', current score is lost and the player is switched.


If the user holds the score:

1- The current score is added to the total score.

2- The player is switched.


## Whoever reaches 100 points first wins the game!
